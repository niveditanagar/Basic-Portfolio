            Hello world citizens! My name is Nivedita Nagar (also known as Nivi) and I'm switchig my career to programming.
            <br> I graduated with a Psychology degree and wanted to become a neuropsychologist.
            <br> Unfortunately, there were no jobs available for me. I got tired of waiting for an opportunity so I took matters
            into my own hands.
            <br> The result?... Here I am in this bootcamp trying to learn this mystery (at least for now) called coding.
            <br> For the next three months I will have to eat, breathe, walk, and talk coding. It is true what they say...you
            must believe in yourself.
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Once this bootcamp is over and I secure a job, I can get back to doing my most beloved hobbies.
            <br> If you want to know what I like doing on the side then let me tell you what exactly are my hobbies.
            <br>
